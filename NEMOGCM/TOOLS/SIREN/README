This is a first release of SIREN.

To create SIREN documentation, go to ./src and run doxygen 
(http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html version 1.8.3.1 or upper)
then
   open ../doc/index.html 
or 
   run ../doc/latex/gmake and open refman.pdf 


templates of namelists could be find in templates directory.
read documentation for more information.

 1- program to create coordinate file :

   ./create_coord create_coord.nam


 Variables are extracted from the input coordinates coarse grid and
 interpolated to create fine coordinates files.

 2- program to create bathymetry file:

 ./create_bathy create_bathy.nam

 Bathymetry could be extracted from fine grid Bathymetry file, or
 interpolated from coarse grid Bathymetry file.

 3- program to merge bathymetry file at boundaries :

 ./merge_bathy merge_bathy.nam

 Coarse grid Bathymetry is interpolated on fine grid.
 Then fine Bathymetry and refined coarse bathymetry are merged at
 boundaries.

 4- program to create restart file :

 ./create_restart create_restart.nam

 Variables are read from restart file, or standard output.
 Then theses variables are interpolated on fine grid.
 Finally table are split over new decomposition.

 5- program to create boundary files (OBC) :

 ./create_boundary create_boundary.nam

 Variables are read from standard output.
 Then theses variables are interpolated on fine grid boundaries.
